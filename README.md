Key Components:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:**

- Utilized Terraform to provision AWS resources, ensuring consistent and scalable infrastructure.

- **Configuration Management with Ansible:**

- Implemented Ansible for seamless configuration of infrastructure components, including Jenkins and Ansible servers.

- **Jenkins CI/CD Automation:**

- Developed Jenkins pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments, promoting efficient software delivery.

- **Docker Containerization:**

- Implemented Docker for containerization, creating lightweight, portable, and scalable application environments.

- **Artifact Management with JFrog Artifactory:**

- Configured JFrog Artifactory for centralized artifact storage, enabling version control and distribution.

- **Code Quality Assessment using SonarQube:**

- Integrated SonarQube for continuous code quality assessment, enforcing coding standards and identifying issues early.

- **Kubernetes Orchestration:**

- Utilized Kubernetes for container orchestration, ensuring efficient deployment and scaling of containerized applications.

- **Maven for Build Management:**

- Integrate Maven for effective project build management, ensuring dependency resolution and standardized project structures.

- **Benefits:**

- Accelerated software delivery with automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration consistency with Terraform and Ansible.
- Enhanced code quality through SonarQube analysis.
- Efficient containerization and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Streamlined artifact management and version control using JFrog Artifactory.


- **Outcome:**
  
- **A robust, end-to-end DevOps pipeline that seamlessly integrates AWS services and best-in-class tools, promoting collaboration, scalability, and continuous improvement in software development processes.**
